As a **site user** I can **view a paginated list of posts** so that **I can select which post I want to view**
- AC1 - "Given more than one post in the database, these multiple posts are listed"
- AC2 - "When a user opens the main page a list of posts is seen"
- AC3 - "Then the user sees all post titles with pagination to choose what to read"
